<p>
				☛ Buffett was born in 1930 in Omaha, Nebraska, the second of three children and the only 
                son of Leila (née Stahl) and Congressman Howard Buffett. He began his 
                education at Rose Hill Elementary School. In 1942, his father was 
                elected to the first of four terms in the United States Congress, and 
                after moving with his family to Washington, D.C., Warren finished elementary 
                school, attended Alice Deal Junior High School and graduated from what was then 
                Woodrow Wilson High School in 1947, where his senior yearbook picture reads: "likes math; 
                a future stockbroker."After finishing high school and finding success with his side 
                entrepreneurial and investment ventures, Buffett wanted to skip college to go directly into 
                business but was overruled by his father.<br><br>

				☛ Buffett displayed an interest in business and investing at a young age. 
                He was inspired by a book he borrowed from the Omaha public library at age 
                seven, One Thousand Ways to Make $1000. Much of Buffett's early childhood 
                years were enlivened with entrepreneurial ventures. In one of his first business 
                ventures, Buffett sold chewing gum, Coca-Cola bottles, and weekly magazines 
                door to door. He worked in his grandfather's grocery store. While still in high school, 
                he made money delivering newspapers, selling golf balls and stamps, and detailing cars, 
                among other means. On his first income tax return in 1944, Buffett took a $35 deduction 
                for the use of his bicycle and watch on his paper route.In 1945, as a high school sophomore, 
                Buffett and a friend spent $25 to purchase a used pinball machine, which they placed in the local 
                barber shop. Within months, they owned several machines in three different barber shops across Omaha. 
                They sold the business later in the year for $1,200 to a war veteran.
                <br><br>

				☛ Buffett worked from 1951 to 1954 at Buffett-Falk & Co. as an investment salesman; 
                from 1954 to 1956 at Graham-Newman Corp. as a securities analyst; from 1956 to 1969 
                at Buffett Partnership, Ltd. as a general partner; and from 1970 as Chairman and CEO of 
                Berkshire Hathaway Inc.In 1951,Buffett discovered that Graham was on the board of 
                GEICO insurance. Taking a train to Washington, D.C. on a Saturday, he knocked on the door 
                of GEICO's headquarters until a janitor admitted him. There he met Lorimer Davidson, GEICO's 
                vice president, and the two discussed the insurance business for hours. Davidson would eventually
                 become Buffett's lifelong friend and a lasting influence,and would later recall that he 
                 found Buffett to be an "extraordinary man" after only fifteen minutes. Buffett wanted to 
                 work on Wall Street but both hisfather and Ben Graham urged him not to. He offered to 
                 work for Graham for free, but Graham refused.<br><br>

				☛In 1952, Buffett married Susan Thompson at Dundee Presbyterian Church. 
                The next year they had their first child, Susan Alice. In 1954, Buffett accepted 
                a job at Benjamin Graham's partnership. His starting salary was $12,000 a year 
                (about $116,000 today).There he worked closely with Walter Schloss. 
                Graham was a tough boss. He was adamant that stocks provide a wide margin of 
                safety after weighing the trade-off between their price and their intrinsic value. 
                That same year the Buffetts had their second child, Howard Graham. In 1956, Benjamin 
                Graham retired and closed his partnership. At this time Buffett's personal savings were 
                over $174,000(about $1.66 million today)[and he started Buffett Partnership Ltd.<br><br> 
 
                ☛ It would be ideal to sit with Warren, have some Burger King Whopper burger 
                with him and pick his brains. But the next best thing would be to read about 
                his investment and management principles. We are blessed to have awesome authors 
                write their analysis of his life, his strategies and his results and compile them 
                into great books.<br><br>
